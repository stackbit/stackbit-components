 * To add components using dynamic imports update the 'dynamic' property in
 * .stackbit/components-map.json file.
 *
 * To import a component in your code, use the 'getComponent' method from
 * '@stackbit/components/components-registry' and call it with the component'
 * registration key. The key should be the model name, which is stored with
 * every object using the 'type' field.
 *
 * Dynamically imported components are used in places where a parent component
 * can contain different types of child components, and are useful to reduce the
 * bundle size of your site pages: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import
 * For example, a landing page component that can contain different types of
 * section components. In this case, instead of importing a static map of all
 * available section components, effectively including them in the page bundle,
 * it is suggested to use a map of dynamic components and load each of them
 * on demand.
